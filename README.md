# What is this
DownloadTracker is a website where you can track downloads of a file.

I use this to track my plugins downloads.

# Deploying
Click here to deploy to vercel:
[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FLorenzo0111%2FDownloadTracker&env=MONGO)

You'll have to set the <code>MONGO</code> process environment to your mongo uri.

If you need to create your own instance of DownloadTracker you'll have to fork the repository and edit the routes and assets.

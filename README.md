# ❓ What is this
DownloadTracker is a website where you can track downloads of a file.

I use this to track my plugins downloads.

# ➕ Deploying
You'll have to set the following process environment variables:

| key      | description             | example         |
|----------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| DATA     | Allowed github authors  | ["Lorenzo0111"] |

You can do that by creating a .env file. Look at the [example here](blob/master/.env.example).

Then run `npm run start` to start the program.

# 💬 Support
If you need Support you can join my [discord](https://discord.io/RocketPlugins).
